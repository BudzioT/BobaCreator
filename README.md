# Boba Creator
Just a Boba Creator -  site for Boba Workshops, made entirely in HTML/CSS<br>
I never knew using JS helps soo much<br>
I definitely love React now even more<br><br>
I'm sure that I will make some websites now to get rid of the pure HTML/CSS feeling I've gone through

## Difficulties
* I had to somehow create a form that would work, without JS and PHP... done by CSS selectors
* There were A LOT OF bugs and things not working, but finally went through them
* I needed to manually rewrite everything, as I couldn't use loops and store data in files/arrays
* No components mean a lot of pain
